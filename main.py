# TODO next:
# refactor the enemy handling system so that they are in the json map, 
# and they are generated in the world and handled in the world (render, update)

# TODO find where handleBarrierCollision is called and update parameters

# ask andrew:
# how should the player be able to control where they shoot?
# should the player be free to move all over the screen (including diagonals) or only up/down left/right?
# how should the camera move? just follow the player anywhere they go or be more 
# steady and stop at the edges and stuff? (ask sophia for detailed description of this)
# can i make Player, world, and camera static?
